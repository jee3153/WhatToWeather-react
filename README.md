###Inspiration 

Looking at numbers on weather app and think what to wear can be time-consuming sometimes. 
We sometimes have ourself to wrong outfit and think oh, I should have worn jacket, or today is a bit hotter than I thought.
However, we are too busy for these things,  we don’t want to experience any inconvenience either.
Instead of looking at confusing numbers in Celsius or Fahrenheit, what about getting an idea what to wear visually through icons?
